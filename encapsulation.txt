What is encapsulation and why is it important?

Encapsulation is the action of surrounding something as if it were in a capsule. 
It is hiding the pieces of something so that other methods or classes can't see or 
operate them. Like in this image over here: 

def _do_outputs(self):
        """Provides a hint for the seeker to use.

        Args:
            self (Director): An instance of Director.
        """
        hint = self._hider.get_hint()
        self._terminal_service.write_text(hint)

        if self._hider.is_found():
            user_input = input("\nWoul you like to play again? yes/no: ")
           
            if user_input.lower() == "yes":
                self._is_playing = True
            else:
                self._is_playing = False
(this is an example from the "seeker" game)

The variables "encapsulated" in a class will be hidden from other classes, and they 
can be used or referenced only through the methods of their current class. I read that
 it is also known as "data hiding".

Encapsulation gives you more control over coupling in your code. It prevents other co-workers
 from breaking changes in the code.
